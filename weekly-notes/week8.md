Meeting with Adrian 3/8 @ 3:15pm
By the end of this semester, we would like a functional prototype using us three as controlled variables
Meaning, we will not focus our effort on creating a database, instead just use our immediate info, or even hard coded values to test the backend, our use of data structures, and the frontend

Frontend Adrian:
Basic Summary (Mo) | Multiple friends using web application will find closest study area based on immediate location when web app is in use

- Using React library for Frontend
- MaterialUI framework -> Streamlined styles
- <[Adrian's Wireframe](https://excalidraw.com/#json=rWHm8DqPR_pFkWYw2cv5E,CmeiDr72m9k8FTxkgwOshw)>

Backend Simple Backlog:
Use simple map data to find closest location?
Socket management (for prototype), will each web instance need to create their own backend instance for socket communciation? (I will look into this when I have time - Ivan)
