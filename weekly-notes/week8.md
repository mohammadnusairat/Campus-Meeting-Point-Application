## Meeting Notes:

By the end of this semester, we would like a functional prototype using us three as controlled variables.
Meaning, we will not focus our effort on creating a database, instead just use our immediate info, or even hard coded values to test the backend, our use of data structures, and the frontend

Frontend Adrian:
Basic Summary: Multiple friends using web application will find closest study area based on immediate location when web app is in use

- Using React library for Frontend
- MaterialUI framework -> Streamlined styles
- <[Adrian's Wireframe](https://excalidraw.com/#json=Js3d3bq6b_CHewkD6FfHe,uw3s7M5aRdA1P_RIZneJCA)>

Backend Simple Backlog:
Use simple map data to find closest location?
Socket management (for prototype), will each web instance need to create their own backend instance for socket communciation?

## Action Items (Work In Progress):

Ivan - Look into Socket connections for Javascript/React library
Adrian - Create Figma for frontend design
Mo - Look over dijkstra algorithm we implemented, and figure out how to translate to Python
