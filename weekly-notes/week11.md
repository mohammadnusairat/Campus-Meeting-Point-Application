## Recent Progress:

We spent the week before break discussing whether continuing our project idea was a worthwhile effort. Ivan made a post asking the instructors whether our project would break any academic rules... Dr. Reckinger said that there would be no rules broken, but since our demo will be graded on originality, we would suffer there.
Understanding this we decided to take a different approach, and decided to think of ways to expand or generate a new idea for this project.

## Meeting Notes:

During this meeting, we discussed use cases for the advanced data structures that we were familiar with. Ivan mentioned tries due it being his favortite ADT thus far. Because tries are known for fast lookups, we thought it would be interesting to include a search bar for buildings in the OSM package.
We will use disjoint set union to compute connected components of the graph. This is used to track connected components in the graph efficiently. When building the graph, nodes are joined into sets as edges are added. This allows O(1) time checks to determine whether any two nodes are in the same connected component.
Now that we have our two data structures, we thought it would be interesting to have a functional UIC map that provides the user with building information (such as includes, bathroom, study rooms, recreational settings, food, etc) and directions to a building from the building they are currently at.

## Action Items (Work In Progress):

Ivan Task: Create a search bar that queries a trie backend on event "character entered on search bar"
Adrian Task -> Create a new diagram showing the Frontend GUI before development
Mohammad Task -> <Include your tasks here>
